The project was developed taking into account all the requirements for the REST architecture.  
Responses from the API come in JSON format.  
   
For the correct launch and operation of the site, `you must`:
- download the project as an archive or import into the IDE;
- at the project command line, run the command: composer install;
- add your data when connecting to the database (.env file);
- create a database and run the script (/assets/sql/script.sql), changing the database name to your own;
- add your data for the mail client (send.php file);
- start the local server and follow the path: http://localhost/index.php (you may need to change the redirection rules in the .htaccess file).
