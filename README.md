The project was developed taking into account all the requirements for the REST architecture.  
Communication (requests / responses) with the server and API is in JSON format.  
I deployed the application on the hosting. `Go to this address:` http://php-rest-api.zzz.com.ua/index.php  

## Project Implementation Requirements

For the correct launch and operation of the site, `you must`:
- download the project as an archive or import into the IDE;
- at the project command line, run the command: composer install;
- add your data when connecting to the database (.env file);
- create a database and run the script (/assets/sql/script.sql), changing the database name to your own;
- add your data for the mail client (send.php file);
- start the local server and follow the path: http://localhost/index.php (you may need to change the redirection rules in the .htaccess file).
